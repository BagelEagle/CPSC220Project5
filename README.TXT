USER INSTRUCTIONS: 
    Welcome to James Amador's Mastermind!
    Traditionally, Mastermind is a two-player game where
    one player (the Code Maker) creates a code consisting
    of 4 pegs in secret. Each peg can be one of six colors:
    Red, Yellow, Blue, Green, Black, and White.
         
    For added difficulty, one of the 4 pegs in the code may
    be omitted for added difficulty, and repeats may be
    permitted.
         
    The other player (the Code Breaker) attempts to 'break'
    the Code Maker's code. The job of the Code Maker is to
    tell the Code Breaker how many pegs are a direct match
    and how many pegs are of the correct color but are in
    the incorrect position. The trick to the game is the
    Code Maker doesn't tell the Code Breaker which exact pegs
    are a direct match or which ones are a partial match.
         
    Each round, the Code Breaker has 10 attempts to correctly
    guess the code. With each attempt, the Code Breaker gives
    feedback. After a predetermined number of rounds where the
    Code Maker and Breaker swap roles every round, the player
    who guessed the code correctly in the fewest guesses
    overall wins.
         
    This program is single-player only and the roles are
    permenant. The Computer is always the Code Maker.
    You win if you guess correctly within 10 guesses, and lose
    if you cannot guess the code within the allotted attempts.
         
    Some useful commands you may find useful:
    'Help'    : Displays list of valid commands.
    'Rules'   : Lists the rules of the game within the program.
    'Quit'    : Exits the game.
         
    The valid peg colors are as follows: 
    Red, Yellow, Blue, Green, Black, White
    Repeats are allowed, and you may type in caps or lower case.
         
    Best of luck ;)
